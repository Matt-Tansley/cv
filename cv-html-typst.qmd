## Summary

I am a dedicated and focused test engineer with experience in automation and performance testing, and a passion for continuous learning, especially in modern tools and best practices. I value collaborative environments where building strong relationships helps drive meaningful outcomes and shared success. I'm seeking a supportive and growth-oriented team culture where I can contribute my skills, learn from others, and help deliver high-quality software.

## Experience

#### Assurity Consulting

**Senior Test Engineer**, *October 2024 --- Present*

**Test Engineer**, *June 2021 --- October 2024*

- Maintained a large existing JMeter regression test suite covering a website, APIs, and authentication. As information was often scattered and incomplete, I took the initiative to consolidate existing documentation and create new material where it did not exist. This required gaining a deep understanding of the test suite, and close collaboration with team members and stakeholders to leverage their knowledge.
- Upskilled in k6, a modern JavaScript-based load testing tool, through a short-term project. I successfully learned and applied the new tool, and as a result the test suite was more maintainable and followed better software engineering practices compared to JMeter.
- Acted as a product owner for an internal project. Improved upon my skills of facilitation, prioritisation, and task management using Jira. Later, I joined a project that was tracking work in a spreadsheet; I introduced Jira and facilitated stand-ups, significantly improving collaboration and visibility.
- Collaborated closely with stakeholders to design realistic load test scenarios. While technical correctness is important, real-user feedback is important in understanding how a system truly operates. 
- Introduced automated report generation into our workflow using Quarto, improving consistency of visualisations and saving time by eliminating the need to manually create and copy-paste images. For example, one report that previously took 3 hours now takes under 30 minutes.
- Mentored and guided new team members joining the company, including helping more experienced colleagues upskill in tools used by our team such as GitHub Actions and our in-house cloud platform.
- Contributed to the graduate programme by preparing and delivering an introductory session on SQL and databases.
- Demonstrated keenness to continuously learn by obtaining certifications.
